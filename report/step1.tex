\section{Requirements Analysis}
\subsection{Requirements}
\subsubsection{Functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 3 local area networks: one for the headquarters, and two for the branches in Nha Trang and Da Nang
  \item Wide area network connecting from the headquarters to the branches
  \item Use new technologies for network infrastructures 100/1000 Mbps wired and wireless connections
  \item \textbf{Headquarters}: 100 workstations, 5 servers, 12 network devices or more with security devices
  \item \textbf{Branches}: 50 workstations, 3 servers, 5 network devices or more with security devices
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The network is organized according to the VLAN structure
  \item Use both \textbf{licensed} and \textbf{open-source} software, office applications, client-server applications, multimedia and database
  \item \textbf{High security}: System must be able to prevent network attacks like DDoS, MiTM,\dots
  \item \textbf{Robust}: Handle all inputs, expected and unexpected
  \item \textbf{Scalable}: The network can be extended by adding more devices
  \item \textbf{Total upload, download}: Servers: 500 MB/day; Workstations: 100 MB/day; WiFi: 50 MB/day
  \item \textbf{Growth rate}: At least 20\% every 5 years
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Checklist}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hardware availability
  \item Hardware location and distribution
\end{itemize}

\subsection{High Load Areas}
It is expected that a lot of operations are executed at the servers, thus a lot of data will go through this area.
High load areas should be at where the server density is the highest.

\subsection{Network Structure}
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology
We will use the tree-topology with a central switch as the root node, connecting to the smaller networks.
These smaller networks will make use of star-topology as there are multiple devices connecting to a common router.

\subsection{Wireless Coverage}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The wireless design at the HQ is similar to the design at the branches
  \item Preferably, each floor will have one wireless AP
  \item APs are connected to routers so as to provide DHCP capability
  \item Up to 253 users can be connected to the standard channel 1--2.412GHz
  \item Use WPA2-PSK with AES for authentication
  \item Forbid pinging local subnet devices from another subnet
\end{itemize}
